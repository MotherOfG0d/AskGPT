# AskGPT

This is an **Alfred Workflow** that enables you to ask **ChatGPT** from anywhere while typing. With this Workflow, you can activate it in any window just by typing `\\gpt`, and it will swiftly generate the content you desire based on your commands. It's like having a genie in a bottle that instantly fulfills your commands!

## Getting Start

- Download and install "AskGPT" from https://github.com/phguo/AskGPT/releases.
- Set the required Environment Variables.
  - `API_KEY`: the OpenAI API key that can be obtained from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
  - `PYTHON_ENV`: the Python environment that has `openai`, `keybord`, and `pyperclip` installed. Note that you must use the absolute directory of Python, which can be found by `which python` in `Terminal`, for Alfred Workflow.
  - `CLIPBOARD_KW`: If you input the value of `CLIPBOARD_KW` ("`clip`"), it will be replaced with the clipboard content.
  - `SIGNATURE`: If the value is set to "`1`", a line like "`[Generated by ChatGPT, 2023-03-26 05:22:13]`
    " will be attached at the end of generated content.
